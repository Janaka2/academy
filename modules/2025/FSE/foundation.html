<h1>Foundation: Engineering Mindset &amp; Setup</h1>
<p>Welcome to the first step of your engineering journey! This is where we build your mindset, get your tools ready, and lay the groundwork for success. Remember, anyone can feel like they’re <strong>behind</strong> or that the world is moving too fast. But right now, you're here and you have the power to make today count. Let go of any doubts or past setbacks—they don’t define you. Focus on this moment and let's get started.</p>

<h2>Your Mindset: Growth, Grit, and Purpose</h2>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed by the fast pace of technology? You’re not alone. Every engineer starts with the same questions and doubts. The trick is not to chase perfection or fear failure. Instead, embrace a <em>growth mindset</em>: see challenges as chances to learn, not as walls stopping you. It’s okay if you haven’t mastered everything yet. You <strong>can</strong> learn, one step at a time, with consistent effort and curiosity. 🚀</p>
<p>Think of these 90 days as your sprint of discovery. Each day you show up is a victory. Celebrate the small wins (every line of code, every bug fixed, every Git commit). Keep your eyes forward and remember: it's about progress, not perfection. You've got what it takes. Stay focused, stay curious, and trust yourself to figure things out. You got this! 🎉</p>

    <ul class="checklist">
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Break big goals into daily tasks</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Practice a growth mindset: say "I can learn this!"</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Take short breaks to recharge</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Ask questions when you’re stuck</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Celebrate each milestone (big or small)</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<h2>Your Environment: Setup for Success</h2>
<p>Let’s get your workspace and tools ready. A good environment includes both physical comfort and the right software. Find a quiet spot, get a comfy chair and some natural light, and make sure you have a reliable computer. Now, let's install the tools you'll use daily:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Java Development Kit (JDK):</strong> This is the engine behind Java. Install the latest JDK so you can compile and run code.</li>
    <li><strong>IDE (Integrated Development Environment):</strong> Try IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing code. These tools offer features that make coding easier.</li>
    <li><strong>Version Control (Git):</strong> Download Git and create a GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) account. Version control is your safety net; it tracks every change you make to your code.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication Tools:</strong> Slack, Discord or similar tools will help you connect with mentors and peers. Don’t go it alone — use your community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your environment is set up, try creating your first Java project and making an initial Git commit. It’s okay if this feels new—each click is progress. By the end of day 1, you should have the key tools installed and a repository initialized. That’s already a win!</p>

<h2>Git Discipline: Your New Habit</h2>
<p>Git might look confusing at first, but it’s one of the most empowering skills you’ll gain. Think of Git as a magical undo button and a team chat for code. Here’s how to master it:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Commit Often:</strong> Save your work frequently with clear commit messages. Every commit tells a story of what you did.</li>
    <li><strong>Branch Out:</strong> Work on new features in branches. This keeps the main code safe and organized.</li>
    <li><strong>Push Your Code:</strong> Regularly push commits to your remote repo (like GitHub). This is like sending your progress report; it's safe and backed up online.</li>
    <li><strong>Pull Often:</strong> If you’re working with others (or even just yourself on multiple devices), pull changes from the remote repo to stay up to date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Git discipline keeps your project clean and your mind at ease. Imagine having a time machine for your code – that’s Git. 💾 The habit of version control will serve you well beyond these 90 days.</p>

<h2>Clean Code: Quality from Day One</h2>
<p>Writing code is creative, but quality matters. Clean code is like tidy notes; it makes it easier to come back and understand what you did. Here’s your clean code mantra:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Use consistent naming and formatting. If you name a class <code>MyCalculator</code>, name variables clearly too.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> Don’t over-complicate. If a function is too long or confusing, break it into smaller pieces.</li>
    <li><strong>Readability First:</strong> Write code for humans first (your future self!), then for machines. Good comments and spacing are your friends.</li>
    <li><strong>Refactor Gently:</strong> As you learn more, revisit old code and clean it up. This is normal and a sign of growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry about being perfect from the start. Every great engineer improves over time. The most important thing: <strong>write it, test it, learn from it, then make it better</strong>. That cycle is how greatness is built.</p>

<h2>Java Toolchain: Your Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Java has a rich ecosystem. Here’s what to know:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>JDK &amp; JRE:</strong> The JDK (Java Development Kit) includes the JRE (Runtime). You need these to compile and run Java code.</li>
    <li><strong>Build Tools:</strong> Tools like Maven or Gradle manage dependencies and build your projects. They might seem complex, but they save huge headaches. Start with Maven for simplicity.</li>
    <li><strong>Libraries &amp; Frameworks:</strong> Java has libraries for everything. You’ll start simple, but know that massive resources are available (Spring, Apache Commons, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Latest Java Features:</strong> Learn about new Java features (like modules, streams, or records) as you go. The language evolves; stay curious!</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up the Java toolchain is like gathering your chef’s tools before cooking. With these in place, you'll cook up software efficiently. By the end of week 1, aim to have a simple Java project with an automated build (for example, <code>mvn compile</code>) running. That’s your first mini-milestone!</p>

<h2>Embrace the Journey</h2>
<p>In a fast-moving world, patience is the secret superpower. Everyone learns at their own pace. What matters is consistency and confidence in yourself. You've taken the important first steps by committing to this 90-day sprint and reading this page. That's courage!</p>
<p>Each section above is a milestone on your path. Use the checklists and track your progress. Most of all, <strong>believe in yourself</strong>. You've got the drive to succeed. The present moment – this very step – is where all your power lies. You already have a miracle: the fact that you showed up ready to learn.</p>
<p>The future engineer you’re becoming starts now. Let's do this! 🚀</p>
