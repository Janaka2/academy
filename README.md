# Janaka Academy

*Empowering a new engineers to surpass technical mastery with spiritual depth and ethical integrity.*

## Vision

My mission is to empower the giant within a thousand hearts — guiding each to surpass me not just in engineering skill, but in spiritual depth and ethical integrity. Together, step by step, we’ll create a elite group of technical master minds who innovate with compassion, live by principle, and make the world easier for everyone.

## What We would do

- Step‑by‑step learning paths: Comprehensive curriculum covering Java, Spring Boot, AI integration, and other technologies that enable you to build scalable, modern solutions.

- Hands‑on projects: Real‑world exercises that teach you how to design, develop, and deploy enterprise systems.

- Mentorship and community: Access to a supportive network of mentors and peers committed to your success.

- Ethical and spiritual growth: Guidance on aligning your technical journey with strong ethics and a deeper sense of purpose.
